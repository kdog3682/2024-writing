we were together a long time u and i. in the winter of 2019 i needed a new jacket. At Macy's department store, I tried on lots of diffrnt jackets. from 50 dollar jackets to 250 dollar jackets.

many times i tried on a jacket, and just knew. it wasn't the one. then, i tried on you, and i felt the thrill of a match.

i liked how i looked in the mirror.
some jackets make me feel like im trying to be something im not.
this jacket (you) made me feel like me. but not just me. the me that I wanted to be. this jacket felt sturdy and dependable. could i live up to it?

our adventure thus began

a jacket that i wore with casual jeans.
or formal slacks.

a jacket for the snowy winter
or for a breezy spring evening

a jacket for riding my bike
a jacket for a friend's party

we went everywhere.

my cherished jacket has had my back for so many years. 

you have protected me from rain, snow, and wind. 
you have provided warmth. 

Sometimes feeling down, i go for a walk all snugged up, and feel my spirits refresh.

Thank you.
