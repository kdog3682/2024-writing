hi everyone, my name is al,

my name is mch,

and my name is hx.

Today, we are going to review a percentage question called "more or less than" from the SHSAT. Michelle, please take it away!

Q1

ham bakes 50% more cookies than sam.
if sam bakes 150 cookies, how many cookies do they bake together?


the key to this question is "50% more." in these types of questions, the phrases to watch out for are always: "50% more", "50% of", or "50% less".

Say $next, what is 50% of 150?

1/2 * 150 = 75
But we dont want of. we want more!


so lets take the 75, and add it on top of the original 150. 

75 + 150 = 225 cookies

the final answer is 150 + 225 = 375 cookies


homework:

$1 bakes 20% less cookies than $2, who bakes 30% more cookies than $3.
If $3 bakes 120 cookies, how many cookies do the 3 friends bake altogether?


Every day, sam bakes 100% more cookies than the day before. on day 1, he bakes 2 cookies. how many cookies in total has he baked by day 10?
